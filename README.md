# Qiskit Personal Notes Source Code

These are my **Qiskit** personal notes using Jupyter Notebooks, based on the [Learn Quantum Computation using Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html) textbook. The textbook is intended for use as a university quantum algorithms course supplement as well as a guide for self-learners who are interested in learning quantum programming.

To run these notes correctly, you have to do as if you were using the qiskit-textbook, so follow the instructions below to get everything ready on your computer.

##Â Note

Please bear in mind these are my personal notes. It is intended to have a deeper understanding of Quantum Computing and Qiskit. I am basing on the qiskit-textbook, but adding my own personal explanations and adding the information I consider interesting to deep-dive on some of the concepts.  

I make this repo public as it might help someone, but in any case this is a structured course nor it is intended as so.
These notes are focused mostly on the qiskit programming language.  

I have other personal notes on Quantum Computing which I might add to this repo in the future.


## Installing the `qiskit_textbook` Package

The Qiskit Textbook provides some tools and widgets specific to the Textbook. This is not part of Qiskit and is available through the `qiskit_textbook` package. The quickest way to install this with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is through the command:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-textbook.git#subdirectory=qiskit-textbook-src
```

Alternatively, you can download the folder [`qiskit-textbook-src`](qiskit-textbook-src) and run:

```
pip install ./qiskit-textbook-src
```

from the directory that contains this folder.
